# Journey of Liz

You can go to "Games/Application Files/Journey of Liz/" and double click "Journey of Liz.exe" to play this game. If it is showing you an error message, please try "Setup.exe" in the Games folder first, then "Journey of Liz.exe". If the installer is also showing error message, please send me an email and I'll reply with a playable one to you.

The Source Code folder has everything that runs in the back scene of the game. The .sln file can only be opened in Microsoft Visual Studio 2012.
